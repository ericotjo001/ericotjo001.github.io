A Study on Heatmap-based XAI and Neural Backed Decision Tree</a></b></h5>
          <div class="contentpar">Choe et al have investigated several aspects of Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) with only image label. They addressed the ill-posed nature of the problem and showed that WSOL has not significantly improved beyond the baseline method class activation mapping (CAM). We report the results of similar experiments on ResNet50 with some crucial differences: (1) we perform WSOL using heatmap-based eXplanaible AI (XAI) methods (2) our model is not class agnostic since we are interested in the XAI aspect as well. Under similar protocol, we find that XAI methods perform WSOL with very sub-standard MaxBoxAcc scores. The experiment is then repeated for the same model trained with Neural Backed Decision Tree (NBDT) and we found that vanilla CAM yields significantly better WSOL performance after NBDT training.</div>

These relevant data are intended as the explanations for model predictions that are both user-friendly and easily adjustable by developers. Explanations can thus be finetuned and damage control can be performed with ease.</div>

    <br>
    <b>Explainable Artificial Intelligence</b>. My research revolves around the broad theme explainability, interpretability and transparency in the application of machine learning/deep learning, often grouped under the umbrella of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The objective is to achieve fair and unbiased algorithms.
    <br><br>
    There's a story to each paper.
    <br><br>
    <b>Deep learning for medical AI</b>. We started off with a research that focuses on automation in the pipeline of ischemic stroke diagnosis. Medical image analysis is performed using deep neural network, in particular the U-Net. Furthermore, we apply explainable AI method to understand our results. Without going into details, I found that popular methods in the suite of XAI methods have been rather lacking -some heatmaps generated by XAI methods just didn't make sense!- and thus my study on interpretable AI began. Regardless, I have continued working on deep learning methods with medical image analysis. For example, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00009?context=cs">this paper</a>, ResNet is finetuned for pneumonia classification. Given an X-Ray image, the algorithm quickly tells us if the patient suffers from pneumonia or not.
    <br><br>
    <b>Research on the quality of XAI. Testing metrics</b>. There have been many metrics to measure the success of XAI, including faithfulness and fidelity. Our project is in large part computer vision which also uses localization as a measure of heatmap quality. One of my earliest projects aims to measure localization in the most straightforward manner, and the results are shown in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02899.pdf">this paper</a>. We found that even when deep learning algorithm performs very very well in terms of classification, the heatmaps from XAI methods can still look random! In similar vein, we tested the MaxBoxAcc metric introduced by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360609079_Evaluating_Weakly_Supervised_Object_Localization_Methods_Right_A_Study_on_Heatmap-based_XAI_and_Neural_Backed_Decision_Tree?_sg%5B0%5D=YqJFpAvAiclwn6eDDkga1DXUSeIxOVr9Sy4sStjAOruYpBp4_XQSbG8ONHXaHptEsug-IFe4A6_et-zscJXGSg10oqRU25z7JurHNBlp.E0OIMSkCvbQ3wMJAAMsYwkh6Zla9Z7yFq2Ar7wlvHhusOc7pSxkmKwF02nwTzYY7oIp8rManW8RHeRQQtG9LzA">Choe et al</a>, getting rather interesting results. We really hope that the research community doesn't blindly use heatmaps and claim that they "explain" something in a convenient, cherry-picking manner.
    <br><br>
    <b>Extremity as novelty</b>. The frustration with "working" XAI methods has led me to develop methods with extreme level of transparency. I wanted to demonstrate that it is possible to have meaningful parameters, not just senseless weights and parameter tuning, not just "bigger model is better." The following two papers, one on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15026">universal approximation</a> and another on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15034">reinforcement learning algorithm</a>, are the products. I went as far as giving each neuron in a neural network model a meaning while retaining the properties of recently popular neural network algorithm. There was also a fair attempt in which I used the general pattern theory (a very old math). It's not too fleshed out, but I personally think a modern and less convoluted theory may help with the transparency and fairness of neural network.
    <br><br>
    <b>Debugging</b>. As an extension to my research on univeral approximation, I thought one might be able to improve transparency with ordered data. The idea is to know which training data are "influential" to the decision of an algorithm (this is a research topic in itself). Furthermore, by allowing simple adjustment of ordered data, we allow debugging and temporary fixes that help developers perform (at least emergency) quality control before properly tuning the main algorihtm or performing a makeover. Thus is born the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360462999_kaBEDONN_posthoc_eXplainable_Artificial_Intelligence_with_Data_Ordered_Neural_Network">kaBEDONNN</a>.
    <br><br>
    My research has therefore been a series of well-motivated attempts at dealing with blackbox issues in the machine learning algorithms. From experience, I have approached XAI more carefully, and I really hope to join a research group that has the ambition of creating a formal and rigorous formulations of interpretability and explainability. We ought to admit that the contextual nature of some problems mean that "explanation" and "interpretability" might be ill-defined, and the attempt might be doomed from the start. Regardless, I've equipped myself with generic programming and more specialized skills in machine learning and deep learning. I believe I possess the ability to help advance applied research in this field as well.
